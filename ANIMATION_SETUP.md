# Credit Scoring Animation Setup - DotLottie Ready! 

## Current Status âœ…
Using official LottieFiles DotLottie React player as requested! The component is now ready for your .lottie animation file.

## Steps to Add Your Animation

### 1. Prepare Your Animation File
- Export your credit scoring animation as a `.lottie` file (DotLottie format)
- This is the preferred format for LottieFiles

### 2. Add Animation to Public Folder
```bash
# Place your .lottie animation file here:
public/credit-score-animation.lottie
```

### 3. Component Implementation
The component now uses the official LottieFiles player:

```tsx
import { DotLottieReact } from '@lottiefiles/dotlottie-react';

<DotLottieReact
  src="/credit-score-animation.lottie"
  loop
  autoplay
  className="w-full h-full"
/>
```

### 4. Alternative: Use Regular Lottie (if DotLottie doesn't work)
If you prefer to use regular Lottie instead of DotLottie:

```bash
npm install lottie-react
```

Then replace the DotLottieReact component with:
```tsx
import Lottie from "lottie-react";
import animationData from "/credit-score-animation.json";

// Replace DotLottieReact with:
<Lottie 
  animationData={animationData}
  loop={true}
  autoplay={true}
  className="w-full h-full"
/>
```

## Current Fallback Animation
The component currently shows a beautiful animated fallback with:
- Animated credit score display (850)
- Pulsing background circles
- Animated progress ring
- Bouncing indicators
- A+ rating display

This fallback will automatically hide once you add your actual animation file.

## Testing
1. Add your animation file to `/public/credit-score-animation.lottie`
2. Refresh the page
3. The animation should load automatically
4. Check browser console for any error messages

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure the animation file is in the correct format
- Check browser developer tools for network errors
- Verify the file path is correct
- Make sure the animation file isn't corrupted
